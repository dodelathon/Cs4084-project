2D Wave Shooter
----------------
2D Wave Shooter is a game template which can be used to create a top down wave game. The game features 2 Maps, with explodable barrels,
pickups, different enemies and a shop which can be used to upgrade player stats and attachments for your gun. This template is easy to 
modify as many variables can be tweaked, and sprites and sounds can be replaced. The scripts are neat and well documented.

This asset also comes with a free copy of 'Toolbar 2D', an asset made by me.

Please read the 'Documentation.txt' included in the asset to learn more about the scripts and their functions.

Use
---------------
If you wish to use any of the sprites for production of your own game you can, yet
I don't recommend that as these are only placeholder graphics and may not meet the 
standards of a finished product.

All the sounds used in this template are royalty free, so you can use them in your game.
